As early as 2004, the “Local Agenda 21 Treptow-Köpenick” was adopted, which included a mission statement and a procedure for implementing sustainable development in the district of Treptow-Köpenick. \nFrom 2018 to 2020, this mission statement was revised, aligning it with the United Nations’ Agenda 2030 and its 17 global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \n\nAll of this took place in a practice-oriented and participatory process with various actors in the district, who were able to network and develop concrete measures in a total of 8 workshops. The first workshop was already held in September 2018, while the last one unfortunately had to be postponed until September 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Each workshop followed a similar pattern: after a presentation by topic mentors, general ideas for achieving the respective SDG were first collected from all participants. This collection of ideas was then taken up in small groups and translated into concrete measures. \n\nThe result is a municipal sustainability strategy that was adopted in 2021 and, in addition to the concrete measures, also includes an indicator-based monitoring. \nThis monitoring is published here, in a web-based format. \n\nThe monitoring system consists of two areas: The “measure indicators” are intended to make the results and effects of the adopted measures visible, while the “SDG indicators” represent more comprehensive data for the achievement of the Agenda 2030 goals at the district level. \nThe “measure indicators” were derived directly from the adopted measures. Here you can also find a lot of data which was provided by different actors of the district. Without these data collaborations, it would be difficult to map the adopted measures. \nThe selection of the more general, district-wide SDG indicators, on the other hand, was based primarily on common sustainability indicators (widely used in the literature), which were then placed in the context of Treptow-Köpenick’s sustainability strategy. Official data is primarily used here. \n\nThe website itself is based on the Open-SDG platform and was further developed in cooperation with students of the HTW Berlin. Many thanks therefore go to: Marlene Bueltemann, Grace Dodi, Lucia Feddersen, Christina Gottschalk, Neslihan Kilic, Mia Lohe, Mahulome Pede and Hatice Pinar. \n\nProf. Florian Koch, Sarah Beyer and Chih-Yu Chen from HTW Berlin were involved in the scientific support of the project. \n\nThe person responsible for the Treptow-Köpenick district office is Dennis Lumme, the municipal development policy officer. \n\nHarald Oehlerking was responsible for the design of the sustainability strategy. \n\nThe entire project was funded by the “Servicestelle Kommunen in der Einen Welt” as part of the INDIKON and DATAKON projects.\n","id":""},"/site-repo/en/en/categories/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site-repo/en/en/categories/","title":"Categories\n","content":"Posts by Category\nHere is a list of posts, grouped by category:\n","id":""},"/site-repo/en/en/contact/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site-repo/en/en/contact/","title":"Contact\n","content":"We are interested in your feedback regarding this website and its contents.\n\nIf you have questions about the statistics, data sources, or metadata provided; or if you have suggestions regarding additional site content or data sources, as well as suggestions on how to improve the functionality of this website, including data accessibility, please contact nachhaltigkeit@ba-tk.berlin.de.\n","id":""},"/site-repo/en/en/about/cookies-and-privacy/":{"type":"Pages","url":"/site-repo/en/en/about/cookies-and-privacy/","title":"Legal Notice\n","content":"Publisher\nThe publisher of this website is the district office Treptow-Köpenick of Berlin.\n\nLegal form\nBehörde, Organ der juristischen Person des öffentlichen Rechts\n\nAddress\nBezirksamt Treptow-Köpenick von Berlin\nBüro Bezirksbürgermeister\nRudower Chaussee 4\n12489 Berlin\n\nPostal address\nBezirksamt Treptow-Köpenick von Berlin\t\t\t\t\t\t                           \nPF: 910240\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t           \n12414 Berlin\n\nContact\nTelephone: +49 (030) 90297 - 2351\nE-mail: nachhaltigkeit@ba-tk.berlin.de\n\nEditorial office\nE-mail: nachhaltigkeit@ba-tk.berlin.de\n\nContent/Production\nTreptow-Köpenick District Office and HTW Berlin\n\nSales tax identification number\nDE 814 554 323\n\nHosting\nGitHub\n\nThe following is a description of what data is collected when you use this website and what it is used for.\n\nUser information\nThis website uses cookies and JavaScript tracking code to gather anonymous information about visitors’ usage patterns, in order to improve the navigation of the site, the presentation of its content and the quality of its services.\n\nThe information collected does not include personal details such as your name, age, telephone number, postal address or email address, nor does it allow personal identification of a user.\n\nCookies\nWhen we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable.\n\nWhere services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone.\n\nThese include small files known as cookies.
